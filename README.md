# Overview

This project revolves around creating a hangman game using C++. In this game, a word is randomly selected by the program, and the user's task is to guess it. The main objective is to provide an interactive gaming experience within a C++ environment, showcasing the integration with Visual Studio Code and GitHub.

In the hangman game, players guess letters to uncover a hidden word. Correct guesses reveal letters in the word, while incorrect ones decrease the remaining attempts left at guessing. With limited attempts, players must guess the word correctly to avoid losing the game.
